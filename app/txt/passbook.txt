THE DICEWARE PASSWORD BOOK

DIRECTIONS:
 
    To use this book, do the following:
 
    1. Print it out on six separate sheets of paper (optional)
 
    2. With one die:
        Roll the die to select the page.
        Roll the die again to select a block on the page
        Roll the die again to select a column in the block
        Roll the die a final time to select a row in the column
 
    You can accomplish this same procedure by rolling two dice twice or four
    dice once (being careful not to rearrange the order in which the dice
    land, as this can introduce bias into the procedure).
 
    NOTE: It is preferable to use a cup when rolling the dice in order to
    reduce the possibility of non-randomness. Give a minimum of 5 or 6 good
    shakes between rolls. This is the only source of randomness in the
    password, so treat it accordingly.
 
ABOUT:
 
    This password book consists of 1,296 concrete nouns, each of 8 letters or
    less. I have chosen concrete nouns that I hope are universally known,
    easily visualized, difficult to misspell and (thus) easy to remember.
 
    Because every word is a dictionary word, there is no entropy in
    the words themselves, only in the choice of a word. The log base two of
    1,296 is log_2(1296) = 10.34, so you get about 10 bits of entropy per
    word randomly selected from this password book.
 
    While some words are sub-strings of other words in the dictionary, this
    does not affect the entropy calculation because no word in the dictionary
    can be exactly formed by joining any two other words in the dictionary.
    So, even though "oatstool" contains the word "stool", it is still
    distinct from "oatsstool".
 
    You should choose the number of words selected from this password book
    to form a single password according to the security requirements of your
    application, but you should never use less than four words, as of 2013.
    This minimum will only increase with time.
 
    If you are baffled by this book, see http://xkcd.com/936 for an
    explanation of why you might want to use a password book, such as this.
    You can also search "diceware" in a web search engine to find out why
    you might want to avoid computerized password generators.
